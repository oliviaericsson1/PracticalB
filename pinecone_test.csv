In other words, it's a type of binary search tree where we tolerate a certain amount of imbalance in order to potentially achieve better performance when maintaining the balance."

This requires periodic restructureing of the tree to detect and correct imbalance whenever it happens."
MiniLM,Mistral,200,100,How do you create a hash map?,150.30287249999998,30.87501924999998,6.67695426940918,"Based on the context, to create a hash map for the given problem, we will use the following steps:

1. Initialize an empty list of size 10, where each index represents a slot in the hash table.

2. Implement a separate chaining collision resolution technique by having each slot (index) point to a linked list.

3. Define a function that takes a key (A or B) as input and returns the corresponding hash value using the specified hash function (Version A: h(A) = A mod 10 or Version B: h(B) = lookupASCII(B) mod 10).

4. Use the hash value to determine which slot in the table we need to insert into, and add a new node to that slot's linked list with the key-value pair (A:B).

5. Implement functions like hset(), hget(), hgetall() etc., to interact with the hash map.

Here is some sample Python code for creating a basic hash map using separate chaining:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

class HashMap:
    def __init__(self, size=10):
        self.size = size
        self.table = [None] * size

    def hash(self, key):
        return key % self.size  # or use lookupASCII(B) mod 10 for Version B

    def insert(self, key, value):
        index = self.hash(key)
        if self.table[index] is None:
            self.table[index] = Node(key, value)
        else:
            node = self.table[index]
            while node.next:
                node = node.next
            node.next = Node(key, value)

    def hset(self, key, value):
        index = self.hash(key)
        if self.table[index] is None:
            self.table[index] = Node(key, value)
        else:
            node = self.table[index]
            while node.next:
                node = node.next
            node.next = Node(key, value)

    def hget(self, key):
        index = self.hash(key)
        if self.table[index] is not None:
            node = self.table[index]
            while node:
                if node.key == key:
                    return node.value
                node = node.next
        return None

# Example usage:
hash_map = HashMap()
hash_map.insert('A', 'value1')
hash_map.insert('B', 'value2')

print(hash_map.hget('A'))  # prints: value1
```

Note that this is a simplified implementation and may not cover all edge cases."
