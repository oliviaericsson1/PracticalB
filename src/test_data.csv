Nomic-Embed,Redis,1000,100,50.65287999999964,0.10284233093261719," In Java, you can create a HashMap (Hash Table) using the HashMap class. Here's an example of how to create and use a HashMap:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, Integer> myHashMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Add elements to the map
        myHashMap.put(""Apple"", 1);
        myHashMap.put(""Banana"", 2);
        myHashMap.put(""Cherry"", 3);

        // Access an element by its key
        System.out.println(myHashMap.get(""Apple"")); // Output: 1

        // Check if a key exists in the map
        System.out.println(myHashMap.containsKey(""Orange"")); // Output: false

        // Iterate through all keys and values
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : myHashMap.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(""Key: "" + entry.getKey() + "", Value: "" + entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we first import the HashMap class from the java.util package. Then, we create a new empty HashMap named myHashMap and use its put method to add key-value pairs. To access an element by its key, you can use the get method. You can also check if a key exists in the map using the containsKey method, and iterate through all keys and values using a for-each loop (entrySet() method).",Mistral

Nomic-Embed,Redis,1000,100,65.44518716599987,0.10289478302001953,"In computing, a hash map is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces an index or key as output, which is used to look up the corresponding value in the map. Here's one way to create a simple hash map:

1. Define a class that represents the hash map, with fields for the keys and values. For example:
```
class HashMap {
  private Map<Integer, String> map;

  public HashMap() {
    map = new HashMap<>();
  }

  public void put(int key, String value) {
    map.put(key, value);
  }

  public String get(int key) {
    return map.get(key);
  }
}
```
2. Create an instance of the hash map class and use it to store key-value pairs. For example:
```
HashMap map = new HashMap();
map.put(1, ""one"");
map.put(2, ""two"");
map.put(3, ""three"");
```
Now you have a simple hash map that can be used to store and retrieve key-value pairs. Of course, this is just one way to create a hash map, and there are many other ways to implement it depending on your specific requirements.

It was designed to solve problems with regular balanced binary search trees, such as the Binary Search Tree, where balance could be lost during insertion or deletion operations. In an AVL tree, the height difference between the two child subtrees of any node must always be within 1. If this condition is violated, the tree is rebalanced by performing rotations on the affected nodes.

1. Using the HashMap constructor, which takes an initial capacity and load factor as parameters. For example:

```java
HashMap<String, Integer> myHashMap = new HashMap<String, Integer>(10, 0.75f);
```

2. Creating an empty HashMap without any initial capacity or load factor:

```java
HashMap<String, Integer> myHashMap = new HashMap<>();

3. Putting key-value pairs into an existing HashMap:

```java
HashMap<String, Integer> myHashMap = new HashMap<>();
myHashMap.put(""Key1"", 1);
myHashMap.put(""Key2"", 2);
// ... continue adding more key-value pairs as needed
```

4. Initializing a HashMap with a collection of key-value pairs:

```java
